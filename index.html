        <p class="love">
          I found a love, for me
          Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
          Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
          Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
        </p>

        <p class="nostelgia">
            Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Not knowing what it was
            I will not give you up this time
            But darling, just kiss me slow
            Your heart is all I own
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine
          
        </p>

        <p class="jolly">
          Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
          With you between my arms
          Barefoot on the grass
          Listening to our favourite song
          When you said you looked a mess
          I whispered underneath my breath
          But you heard it
          Darling, you look perfect tonight
          
        </p>

        <p class="love">
          Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
          She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
          I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
          To carry love, to carry children of our own
         
        </p>
        <p class="nostelgia">
          We are still kids, but we're so in love
            Fighting against all odds
            I know we'll be alright this time
            Darling, just hold my hand
            Be my girl, I'll be your man
            I see my future in your eyes


        </p>
        
        <p class="adm">
          Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favorite song
            I have faith in what I see
            Now I know I have met an angel in person
            And she looks perfect
